### Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN algorithm to Predict Credit Risk

This section presents and analysis of the <b>SMOTEEN</b> algorithm. 

### Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis (2 points)

(4 points) The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate several machine learning models by using resampling to determine which models are best at predicting credit risk.

### The models include the following:

Naïve Random Oversampling</p>
SMOTE Oversampling</p>
Undersampling</p>
Combination (Over and Under) Sampling</p>

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
