# Credit Risk Analysis (2 points for title, with multiple sections)

The report should contain the following:

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis (2 points)

(4 points) The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate several machine learning models by using resampling to determine which models are best at predicting credit risk.

### The models include the following:

Na√Øve Random Oversampling</p>

SMOTE Oversampling</p>
Undersampling</p>
Combination (Over and Under) Sampling</p>

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
