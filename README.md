# Credit Risk Analysis (2 points for title, with multiple sections)

### Deliverable 1 

This section presents an analysis of each of the following algorithms:

#### Naïve Random Oversampling</p>
#### SMOTE Oversampling</p>
#### Undersampling with ClusterCentroids algorithm</p>

Below are screenshots of each of the algorithms, showing the following results:

#### Accuracy score (7.5 points)
#### Confusion matrix (7.5 points)
#### Imbalanced classification report (15 points)

The report should contain the following:

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis (2 points)

(4 points) The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate several machine learning models by using resampling to determine which models are best at predicting credit risk.

### The models include the following:

Naïve Random Oversampling</p>
SMOTE Oversampling</p>
Undersampling</p>
Combination (Over and Under) Sampling</p>

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.

## Summary of the results (2 points)
## Recommendation of which model to use (3 points)
